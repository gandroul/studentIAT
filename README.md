## Abstract  

Internet addiction is a phenomenon with significant implications for mental health. It has been associated with increased levels of anxiety, depression, and burnout. This study investigates the relationship between internet addiction, burnout, anxiety, and depression in a sample of 3,090 students from the University of Patras. The sample is representative of the university's student population and was selected using stratified sampling during November and December 2023. Although the University of Patras is a regional institution, 25% of its students come from the surrounding area, while the remaining 75% originate from other cities across Greece. Internet addiction was assessed using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), anxiety and depression were measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and burnout was evaluated using the Burnout Assessment Tool (BAT). The results revealed positive correlations between internet addiction, burnout, anxiety, and depression. Through cluster analysis (K-means clustering), students were categorized into four groups: (1) Students with low addiction. (2) Students with very high addiction. (3) Students with moderate addiction, characterized by anticipation of use, lack of control, and neglect of activities, which was associated with increased anxiety. (4) Students with excessive use and social withdrawal, which was linked to higher levels of depression. The findings suggest that different dimensions of internet addiction may serve as independent risk factors for anxiety or depression. Understanding these relationships can contribute to developing targeted interventions to promote students' mental health.
